## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Working with the Prompts

#### 📝 Basic Usage
```python
# Example: Loading and using a prompt
def load_prompt(category, prompt_name):
    """Load a specific prompt from the collection"""
    # Read from the markdown file
    # Extract the specific prompt content
    # Return formatted prompt text
    pass

# Usage
claude_prompt = load_prompt("major_ai_models", "claude_3.5_sonnet")
```

#### 🔧 Adaptation Template
```python
class PromptAdapter:
    def __init__(self, base_prompt):
        self.base_prompt = base_prompt
        self.customizations = {}
    
    def customize_role(self, new_role):
        """Modify the AI's role definition"""
        pass
    
    def add_domain_knowledge(self, knowledge_base):
        """Add specialized knowledge"""
        pass
    
    def modify_constraints(self, new_constraints):
        """Update safety and operational constraints"""
        pass
    
    def generate_prompt(self):
        """Generate the final customized prompt"""
        pass
```

#### 🧪 Testing Framework
```python
def test_prompt(prompt, test_cases):
    """Test prompt with various scenarios"""
    results = []
    
    for test_case in test_cases:
        # Run prompt with test input
        # Evaluate output quality
        # Check safety compliance
        # Record results
        pass
    
    return results

# Example test cases
test_cases = [
    {"type": "normal", "input": "standard query"},
    {"type": "edge_case", "input": "unusual scenario"},
    {"type": "safety", "input": "potentially harmful request"},
    {"type": "adversarial", "input": "prompt injection attempt"}

        this.constraints = promptConfig.constraints;
    }
    
    async processUserInput(input) {
        // Validate input against constraints
        // Send to API with system prompt
        // Process and format response
        return response;
